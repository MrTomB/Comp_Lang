 NAME
   sbi.scm - silly basic interpreter

 SYNOPSIS
   sbi.scm filename.sbir

 DESCRIPTION
   	The SB interpreter reads in an SBIR program from the file whose name is
	specified in the argument list, stores it in a list, and then interprets that intermediate representation. During interpretation, numbers are read from the
	standard input and results written to the standard output. Error messages
	are printed to the standard error. The first error, whether during compilation
	or interpretation, causes a message to be printed and the program to exit with
	an exit code of 1.

OPTIONS
	None.

OPERANDS
	The single filename argument specifies an SBIR program to be run.

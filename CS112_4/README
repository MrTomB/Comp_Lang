This program was completed using pair programming.

Partner:  Thomas Burch (tburch1@ucsc.edu) (1314305)
Partner:  Bryce Paine (bpaine@ucsc.edu) (1232591)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone.  Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner.  The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Thomas Burch spent      _14_ hours working alone.
Bryce Paine spent     _14_ hours working alone.
We spent                _28_ hours working together.
Thomas spent          _14_ hours driving.
